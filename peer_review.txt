Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
---- incomplete - README suspiciously looks like a copy
Is there good spec coverage?
---- Better than ours, for sure, probably the best ive seen all day
Do all specs pass?
---- 13 examples, 2 failures :(
Is the application logic clear and easy to navigate?
---- So far, so good (not helpful comments, but it is easy to understand)
Can you make a test payment through Stripe?
---- mostly peeved at this part, unsure of how to purchase novels without this stripe
Is the site user-friendly?
---- not appropriate for anyone under 5, but a 5 year old could use it
Are there opportunities for refactoring?
---- we took a look at errthang, and it seems like everything is fairly solid
What features stand out?
--- the colors, look and feel, layout, the image, the heart is pretty neat, cool fonts, overall girl, your style is fabulousssssssss. ok maybe a little smaller title
What features could be improved?
---- still wondering how to buy these novels pls - the only thing i might add is perhaps an about page to describe more clearly the mission statement of this enterprise
Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
---- u have gud taste, what is ur #
